nagios3 (3.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  I decided to remove the php frontend included with 3.2.0 and replace 
  it with the old html frontend. Its my personal oppinion that php should
  not be used for administrational and security sensitive tasks. Also the new
  frontend looks exactly the same as the old. If you really want the php 
  frontend look into README.Debian for instructions. 

  This release moves the cgi into its own package. The nagios3-cgi package
  is recommended by the nagios3 package, so if you have the lenny default of 
  automatic installation of recommends everything will be as before. But if you 
  disabled automatic installation of recommended packages you will have to install 
  the nagios3-cgi package on your own.

nagios3 (3.0.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  The homedirectory of the nagios user moved to /var/lib/nagios
  which is now common on all nagios related packages. Its recommended
  that you migrate an already existing nagios user to use /var/lib/nagios
  as homedirectory.
